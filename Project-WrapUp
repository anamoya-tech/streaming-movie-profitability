## Project Wrap-Up & Key Takeaways

This project explored **relative impact efficiency** of movies available on Netflix and HBO between 2010 and 2021, using publicly available data and proxy metrics due to the absence of real viewership and budget information.

Rather than attempting to estimate absolute profitability, the analysis focused on **comparative patterns** across platforms, exclusivity strategies, genres, and runtime, under clearly stated assumptions and limitations.

### Key Findings
- **Platform differences:** HBO shows higher average impact efficiency than Netflix under the defined proxy metrics, suggesting differences in catalog composition and content strategy.
- **Exclusivity effects:** Titles shared across platforms tend to concentrate higher efficiency values, while exclusivity alone does not guarantee stronger relative performance.
- **Quality-adjusted impact:** When IMDb score is incorporated, shared titles continue to outperform exclusives, indicating that higher efficiency is not driven by reach alone but also by perceived quality.
- **Genre patterns (exploratory):** Genre-level analysis reveals differentiated efficiency patterns between platforms, although these results are treated as exploratory due to scale differences and uneven sample sizes.
- **Runtime vs efficiency:** No strong relationship is observed between movie duration and impact efficiency, suggesting that runtime—used as a proxy for production effort—does not explain relative performance on its own.

### Methodological Considerations
- All results are based on **proxy metrics** and should be interpreted as **relative comparisons**, not financial outcomes.
- Movies available on multiple platforms were intentionally retained as separate records to reflect distinct availability contexts.
- Exploratory analyses were kept separate from the final dashboard to preserve clarity and avoid over-fragmentation.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytical workflow, from problem formulation and data cleaning to exploratory analysis and clear, executive-level visualization. Emphasis was placed on methodological transparency, responsible use of proxy data, and thoughtful scope management.

The final dashboard communicates the core insights effectively, while additional exploratory analyses remain available for future extensions. Overall, the project reflects a realistic approach to data analysis under real-world data constraints.
